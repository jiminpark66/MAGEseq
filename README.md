# MAGEseq

Here is the code used to parse and quantify fitness of mutants generated from a MAGE-seq experiment for the manuscript X. Currently pretty barebones but will be updated to be more broadly applicable. 

# Analysis overview
1. Merge files (only for pair-end sequencing)
2. Parse sequence variants
3. Compute Fitness

# Dependencies
biopython \n
pandas
